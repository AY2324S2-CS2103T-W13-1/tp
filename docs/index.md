**LoanGuard Pro is a desktop application for managing your contact details.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
It supports basic contact and loan handling features like adding, editing, deleting, and viewing contacts and loans. More advanced features like analysing a client's loaning history are also available.


* If you are interested in using LoanGuard Pro, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing LoanGuard Pro, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
